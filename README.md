Before runing you need to add SPM12 to the Matlab setpath as follows, addpath(genpath('/bcbl/home/public/Ileana/spm12'));
set up SPM defaults, defaults = spm_get_defaults;
You also need to add the folder where you have the functions and SPM templates you are going to use as follows, addpath('/bcbl/home/public/Ileana/PAJARITOS');
